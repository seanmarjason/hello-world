# hello-world
Notes Repository

I am a Business Analyst, and have been for the last 8 years. I have specialised in examining business processes, delivering and evaluating improvement opportunities, driving business changes to adhere to new regulations, and using data to uncover business requirements and define the scope of projects. 

I am now looking to focus directly on data, using it as both a indicator of business needs and as a driver of continuous improvement and change. Data is real, and data is abundant in today's business landscape. Harnessing data is necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of organisations, enabling greater understanding of the drivers of business performance. Data can also be used to drive societal change and uncover the needs of the community at large. This is where, for me, data can generate the greatest benefits.

The intention of this repository is to demonstrate the work that I do with data, both so that I can improve my analytical skills, and so that others can benefit from the work that I do.
